# Acccounting for nonlinear phenotypes

This repository contains analysis code to accompany the publication 'Harnessing genotype-phenotype nonlinearity to accelerate biological prediction'.<br>

Notebooks containing expanded methods and the code + analyses for generating all figures in the publication can be found in `[01_code/notebooks/](01_code/notebooks/)`.<br>

## Directory structure

`[01_code/](01_code/)` Contains code for simulating phenotypes (Python), analyzing phenotypes (R/Jupyter Notebooks), and predicting phenotypes with an autoencoder (Python).<br>
`[02_outputs/](02_outputs/)` Outputs associated with the pub.<br>

## Data

All data needed to replicate these analyses are available via [Zenodo]([https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://zenodo.org/record/8298808)).<br>

Data used to study empirical variation across sets of phenotypes are publicly available and associated with the following publications:
